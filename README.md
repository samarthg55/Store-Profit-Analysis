Project Summary: Sales Data Visualization
This Tableau project visualizes sales data across various stores and menu items to analyze net sales performance, trends, and key insights. Below is a concise breakdown:
Key Objectives:
1.	Identify High-Performing Menu Items: Determine which menu items drive the highest net sales across store types.
2.	Compare Store Performance: Analyze sales trends across different types of stores (e.g., pubs, coffee shops).
3.	Interactive Insights: Present the data through treemaps and bar charts for easy exploration.
Visualizations:
1.	Treemaps:
•	Grouped by store type and menu items.
•	Visualized net sales to highlight top-performing items (e.g., "Chicken Tenders" in pubs, "Cheese XL" in coffee stores).
•	Color intensity and size indicate relative performance.
2.	Bar Chart:
•	Segregates net sales by store name and menu item.
•	Provides a granular breakdown of individual contributions to total sales.
3.	Dashboards:
•	Net Sales by Menu Item: Organized by store type (pubs, coffee shops, food courts, etc.).
•	Overall Store Trends: Summarizes top-selling items across all categories.

Insights:
1.	Items like "Chicken Tenders" and "Texan Burger" dominate pub sales.
2.	Coffee shops excel with items such as "Cheese XL" and specialty drinks.
3.	Food courts have diverse, smaller-scale contributions to overall sales.

Value: 
This project demonstrates proficiency in creating interactive dashboards, insightful visualizations, and actionable analytics for decision-making. It’s a powerful showcase of data visualization skills suitable for business analysis or portfolio work.
